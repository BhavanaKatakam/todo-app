Overview of the System Design

The Todo List application is designed using React, adopting a component-based architecture to ensure modularity and maintainability. At the core of the application is the App component, which manages the overall state and functionality of the todo list. The application is divided into several key components: TodoForm for adding new tasks, TodoList for displaying the list of tasks, TodoItem for representing individual tasks, and Search for filtering tasks. Data persistence is achieved using the browser's local storage, allowing tasks to be saved and loaded across sessions.

Explanation of the Implementation

The App component serves as the root component, handling the state for the list of todos and the search query. It also contains functions for adding, updating, and deleting todo items, which are passed down to child components as props. The TodoForm component provides an input field and a button for users to add new tasks. When a task is added, it updates the state in the App component, which in turn re-renders the TodoList.

The TodoList component receives the list of todo items and the functions for updating and deleting tasks as props from the App component. It maps over the list of todos and renders a TodoItem for each task. The TodoItem component includes functionality for editing the task's text and description, marking it as completed, and deleting it. It also displays the last updated timestamp. The Search component allows users to filter the list of tasks based on their search query, which is also managed in the App component's state.

The application's state is synchronized with the local storage to ensure data persistence. This is done by saving the state to local storage whenever there is a change and loading the state from local storage when the application initializes.

Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Application


Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-app

Install Dependencies:
npm install

Run the Application:
npm start

Open the Application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.

Build the Application:
npm run build

This will generate a build directory with all the necessary files for deployment.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the Todo List application on your local machine. The modular design and clear separation of concerns in the components make it easy to maintain and extend the functionality of the application.
